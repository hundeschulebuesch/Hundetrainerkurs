- **User Interface**: In the LMS interface, alerts are typically displayed in a dedicated notification area. Unread alerts can be visually distinguished (e.g., bold text, highlight).
- **Marking as Read**: Users can mark alerts as read, which updates the `read` status in the database. This action typically occurs when a user clicks or interacts with the notification.
- **Chronological Display**: Alerts are displayed in chronological order, ensuring that the most recent notifications are seen first.
- **Archiving or Deleting**: Users may have options to archive or delete older notifications, depending on the LMS’s functionality.

**Automated Processing:**
- The LMS backend includes automated processes for generating and managing alerts. These processes monitor the relevant events (like assignment deadlines) and create alerts as needed.
- Additionally, scheduled jobs can run at regular intervals to send out reminders or recurring notifications.

Through the Alert model and associated mechanisms, the LMS ensures that users are kept informed and engaged, enhancing the overall learning experience and ensuring important deadlines or updates are not overlooked.
